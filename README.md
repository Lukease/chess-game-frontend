This project is a chess game application that allows users to play chess online. It provides a user-friendly interface for playing chess with other players. The game follows the standard rules of chess and includes features such as move validation, highlighting available moves, and capturing opponent pieces.

In addition to the chess game itself, this application also includes the following features:
